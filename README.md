# WEB3_DIGITAL_ID
DIDz - Web3 Digital Identity System, is a lightweight identity verification system using social networks of self-assigned attributes. You MINT your own IDENTITY, while other IDz: verify, deny, gatekeep etc. : )

## OVERVIEW

Human Identity is a very complicated concept. It is fluid and mercurial, changing moment to moment.

> any moment any hero can act as villian, and any villian can act as hero.

So how do we determine which is which? Not easy.

## DIDz DESCRIPTION

DIDz is a fun way to organize all that human chaos!

> identity starts with what a person says they are

1) Self-Assigned Identity (SAIDz) are more important than 3rd party ID because (afterall) I am whatever I say I am.

2) 3rd party Identity, is a Social-Assigned Identity (SAIDz) of validation - which is...not always accurate! And this is where IDENTITY begins to go astray from sensibility. 

3) So we have Self-SAIDz and Social-SAIDz. Both can be valid and invalid, and change over time. Now we are getting closer to the crux of the issue here!

4) When VALIDATED as a GOOD-ACTOR, it is called FRIENDz. A social assigned identity by peers who say - this is a good girl or guy or both (what every is self-assigned). See?

5) But now what if you VALIDATE FRIENDz but they turn into a manipulative narcissist, or become "possessed by the devil" or are simply driven by money, and backstab and become competitibely cut-throat in a capitalistic system which incentivizes such behavior. How to we ACCURATELY account for that?

> So to review, IDENTITY is self-assigned, then socially-assigned, but can change over time and is ... always wrong. So that is where the KEY CONCEPT of IDENTITY comes in: fluidity. The mechanism needs to be constantly fluid.

6) NON-STATIC validation of FRIENDz. We anonymously become friends. We anonymously validate that friend over time, and then we can anonymously DISVALIDATE that relationships based on ACTZ.

7) ACTZ are the behaviors of a person. If they are help and support and wize - then they are VALIDATED by PEERS over time. So ACTZ are a major part of IDENTITY, same as ACHIEVEMENTS, SOCIAL-PROOFZ, PEERZ, FRIENDZ, and SAIDZ. Same as DISVALIDZ. 

8) But what about HACKZ and CONZ? A CON is someone who is not who they say they are. But what if they are a STUDENT who is trying to "fake it tell you make it". Not really a CON is it? So this is the fluid nature of identity again. Identity is NON-ABSOLUTE we are always on a SPECTRUM. And that SPECTRUM changes dramatically based on the VALIDATOR. I am, in fact, an excellent basketball player to a team of kindergartners (I schooled em). But to a team of NBA players - I am a CON. Got it? Not so easy a puzzle is it?

9) HACKZ then, would represent a BAD-VALIDATOR. Like a vigilante acting on revenge or jealously. So as to take someone else down - in a competitive way, so that they can rise themselves. Very important ACTZ to know about, yes? So BAD-ACTORZ and BAD-VALIDATORZ need to be seen and not heard.
Where as GOOD-ACTORZ and GOOD-VALIDATORS need to be AMPLIFIED. That is how.

10) We can develop an IDENTITY-MATRIX (ha) to sort out all this ACTUAL-HUMAN-CONFUZION.

11) DIGITAL-IDENTITY-MATRIX (DIDz) specifies the observable categories of the confuzion-spectrum. It goes (something) like this...

### VALIDATION-MATRIX:
- GOOD-ACTOR validating a GOOD-ACTOR, (effective validation) 
- GOOD-ACTOR validating a BAD-ACTOR, (mistaken validation)
- BAD-ACTOR validating a GOOD-ACTOR, (valid in disguise)
- BAD-ACTOR validation a BAD-ACTOR, (bad validation)

And the "inverzionz" (INVZ) also exists.

### DISVALIDATION-MATRIX:
- GOOD-ACTOR disvalidating a GOOD-ACTOR, (mistaken disvalidation)
- GOOD-ACTOR disvalidating a BAD-ACTOR, (effective disvalidation)
= BAD-ACTOR disvalidating a GOOD-ACTOR, (bad disvalidation)
- BAD-ACTOR disvalidating a BAD-ACTOR, (disvalid in disguise)

And a third category for FLUID changing IDENTITY over time

### NONaVALIDATION-MATRIX:
- ACTOR has YET2BEVALUATED
- ACTOR was VALIDATEDMISTAKENLY
- ACTOR was VALIDATEDWRONGLY
- ACTOR was DISVALIDATEDMISTAKENLY
- ACTOR was DISVALIDATEDWRONGLY
- ACTOR was VALIDATEDBUTACTZINVALID
- ACTOR was DISVALIDATEDBUTACTZVALID
- ACTOR has very confuzing ACTZ
- ACTOR did something so bad, was banned for life
- ACTOR asks for REVALIDATION because of wrong or invalid validation
- PEER wants to see STATUS of ACTOR.

> WOWZA! This was a much bigger puzzle than originally thought - I love it!

## OBSERVATIONZ

Smart-Contracts can (absolutely) solve this problem. But lets take it "one-step-at-a-time" - in MVP and PoC phases. Lets systematically add each branch, with a clever system-design that can SCALE into the IDEAL end solution. That means starting simple and gradually adding each branch of interactions, as needed (not before). 

## OBJECTIVEZ

So the PROPOSAL starts with PIRATE or NINJA game. It is subtle, by design, that the MVP is for Self-Assigned Identity. See? Are you a PIRATE or NINJA? You mint whatever token you are, but then as you imagine... it scales out dramtatically from there. 

## DESIGN PRINCIPLEZ

1) Pirate or Ninja is a fundamental question of human identity, with a light-hearted sneer, to a deeply complex puzzle - that BLOCKCHAIN is capable of resolving (fairly).

2) The beauty of Pirate or Ninja is that it is self-assigned. While genius, includes the observations of ACTZ and PEERZ, and by the informed or uninformed perspective of others.

3) Can we SWITCH SIDES? Can we be BOTH? Can we be NEITHER? Wizard or Jester? That's the idea!

4) The MVP (brilliantly) includes the (complex) VALIDATION SYSTEM in parallel with the self-assigned Identity SYSTEM. Where BOTH SCALE up in COMPLEXITY over time. Here is how:

> The DIDz VALIDATOR DAPP, simply receives a WALLET ADDRESS, and it looks up any DIDZ associated with that wallet. The DIDZ can be self-assigned or anonymously peer-assigned. BOTH rightfully or wrongfully. And with NON-STATIC fluidity - meaning - HUMANZ can change their behavior over time (contrary to popular belief).

> Also, the DIDz VALIDATOR DAPP, takes into account DISVALIDATIONZ. Providing multiple (complex) mechanisms for REVALIDATION, DISVALIDATION and ENVALIDATION schemes.

5) GROUPZ and TRIBEZ. Amazingly, Pirate or Ninja may provide unexpected UTILTY for humanz to group-up more effectively than currently possible. For example, I strongly identify with HERMITZ. But there are also BOTZ, DRAGONZ, WOLVEZ, CATZ, WIZARDZ, JESTERZ, CLOWNZ, FALCONZ... etc. How nice would it feel to look up all the other people who have self-identified the same as you?

6) Anonymity is not possible on BLOCKCHAIN PUBLIC-LEDGER. But it is on NodeJS. That is why this project (seems) to require a HYBRID APPROACH of BOTH CENTRALIZED and DECENTRALIZED systems curated in harmony... together. Again, contrary to popular belief.

## FAQ

Why all the 'z's? 
- Because it makes it 'remarkable' and 'unique' The (purposeful) z-misspelling is like "BUIDL". Called the 'Z-factor', it conveys the concept, but in a self-identifying distinct way. After people get the intention, confuzion dissapates, by enhancement of words. Opposite of concepts restricted by the ambiquity of cacophony - or too many words used for too many disparate reasons! Humanz get that we need more tools of intelligence, not less! Z-factor is just one of such powerful tools.
