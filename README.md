# WEB3_DIGITAL_ID

Web3 Digital Identity System (DIDz), is a lightweight and fun, identity verification system, that uses self-assigned attributes, and social-proof to emulate the reality of fluid identity. You MINT your own IDENTITY, while others: validate, verify, deny, or gatekeep... your identity. Interesting? : )

## OVERVIEW

Human Identity is a very complicated concept (contrary to popular belief). It is fluid, changing moment to moment, and can be very confusing.

The entire system is based on key design principles.

### IDENTITY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_#1
> at any moment a hero can act as villian, and
> at any momant a villian can act as hero.

So how do we accurately validate which is which? Not easy.

## DIDz DESCRIPTION

DIDz is a fun way to organize all this human charade!

### IDENTITY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_#2

> your identity starts with what you say you are - not what anyone else says you are.

## CONCEPT: SELF-ASSIGNED-IDENTITY:

1) Self-Assigned Identity (SAIDz) are more important than 3rd party ID because (afterall) 

> I am what I say I am.

2) 3rd party Identity, is projected on others. As Social-Assigned Identity (SAIDz). Of validation or denial, which is frequently inaccurate! And this is where IDENTITY begins to go astray from sensibility. 

> Can BLOCKCHAIN SMART-CONTRACTS solve for accurate IDENTITY-SYSTEMS?
> Are we doomed to repeat an infinite human charade?

3) So, let's start with Self-SAIDz and Social-SAIDz. Both, valid and invalid, and change over time. Now we are getting closer to the crux of the actual issue!

4) When VALIDATED as a GOOD-ACTOR, it is called FRIENDz. A social assigned identity by PEERZ who say - this is a good-girl or good-guy or GOOD-ACTOR (whatever is self-assigned). See?

5) But now what if you VALIDATE FRIENDz but they turn into a manipulative narcissist, or "possessed by the devil" or are simply driven by money, and backstab and become competitively cut-throat in a capitalistic system which actually incentivizes such ACTZ. Are they FRIENDZ or FOEZ? GOOD-ACTOR or BAD-ACTOR? How can we ever ACCURATELY account for all this actual chaos?

> To review this COMPLEX PUZZLE: a) IDENTITY is self-assigned, then b) socially-assigned. Also c) frequently flawed and can d) change over time. So if we are to accurately account for IDENTITY, we need to c) observe the actual nature of: IDENTITY-FLUIDITY and simply reflect its state. So the SMART-CONTRACT mechanism needs to be constantly fluid - or else become eventually flawed and obsolete.

6) NON-STATIC validation of FRIENDz. We anonymously become friends. We anonymously validate that friend over time. And then we can anonymously DISVALIDATE that relationship later. Disvalidation is painful, and is based on whether we forgive or trust or become disinterested in the relationship. That is why the entire IDENTITY-MECHANISM must be OBJECTIVE and ANONYMOUS. 

> You never know exactly, who your true friendz are, until you need them the most, and they chooze to ACT or not ACT on your behalf.

## IDENTITY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_#3

> Any HERO can act a ZERO, and any ZERO can rise to HERO, at any time.

7) ACTZ are the behaviors of a person, driven by CHOICEZ. If they help you and support you, and guide you with wize advice - then they are VALID GOOD-ACTOR to you. ACTZ are validated by many PEERS over time. As a cumulative and quantitative metric. ACTZ are a major part of IDENTITY, same as ACHIEVEMENTS, SOCIAL-PROOFZ, PEERZ, FRIENDZ, and DISVALIDZ. But they are also second to SELF-SAIDZ.

> No one can deny, what any other SOUL... wishes to be. 

8) But what about HACKZ and CONZ, SHARKZ, BOTZ, SABOTORZ, VIGILANTEZ, MINIONZ and ZOMBIEZ? A CON is someone who is not who they claim to be, while SPECIFICALLY trying to DISCIEVE you. That is the importance of ACTZ. Because, what if they are a STUDENT who is trying to "fake it till you make it"? Not really a CON is it? We must find OBJECTIVE ways to DIFFERENTIATE (all) such subtlety. Again, observe the highly-fluid nature of identity. 

> One ACT is forgivable-inno-sense, while the other is distructive-intent. See?

9) Identity is NON-ABSOLUTE. We are always on a SPECTRUM of character. And that SPECTRUM changes dramatically based on the VALIDATOR. Which causes significant CONFUZION and actual chaos among humans. For example: I am, in fact, an excellent basketball player - to a team of kindergardners (I school `em)! But to a team of NBA players - I am a CON. Got it? Not so easy a puzzle is it? 

> Our IDENTITY changes, depending on who validates us.

9) HACKZ then, would represent a BAD-ACTOR, intent on distruction. Like a vigilante acting on misinformation, revenge or jealously, or actual illuzion. Some people are trained, in a competitive way, to impune character -so that they can rise themselves. This is the ACTZ of a BAD-VALIDATOR. And a very important ACTZ to see, yes? 

> So BAD-ACTORZ and BAD-VALIDATORZ need to be seen and not heard. While GOOD-ACTORZ and GOOD-VALIDATORS need to be AMPLIFIED. That is how.

10) Indeed, we can develop a MATRIX - to sort out all this ACTUAL-HUMAN-CONFUZION. 

## IDENTITY_DESIGN_PRINCIPLE_#4 | "Purity not Security. Mountain-Water, not Castle-Moat"

> Do not structure IDENTITY-SYSTEMS like an archaic CASTLE. Designed with endless elaborate traps and moats and gate-keeping to keep bad-actors out. Because the defenses become a pollution themselves. Not only does it fail to keep bad-actors out. With no recourse to a king or bishop (in a clever-disguise). But even when the bad-actors are kept at bay, notice how the barbed-wire also keeps the good-actors out! The entire castle system concept of security is flawed.

> Instead of endless faulty bot-defense-mechanisms. Let's design IDENTITY SYSTEMS to filter out pollution like mountain-water. Like, a mountain stream effortlessly causes heavy elements to sink into the mud of a swamp, while the pure water floats to the top and runs to the city, to total benefit of GOOD-ACTORS. This is how!

11) DIGITAL-IDENTITY-MATRIX (DIDz) specifies the observable categories of the confuzion-spectrum. So as to more accurately IDENTIFY ACTZ that distruct, from ACTZ that encourage. It goes (something) like this...

### VALIDATION-MATRIX:
- GOOD-ACTOR validates a GOOD-ACTOR, (effective validation) 
- GOOD-ACTOR validates a BAD-ACTOR, (mistaken validation)
- BAD-ACTOR validates a GOOD-ACTOR, (valid in disguise)
- BAD-ACTOR validates a BAD-ACTOR, (bad validation)

And the "inverzionz" (INVZ) also exists - in actual reality.

### DISVALIDATION-MATRIX:
- GOOD-ACTOR disvalidates a GOOD-ACTOR, (mistaken disvalidation)
- GOOD-ACTOR disvalidates a BAD-ACTOR, (effective disvalidation)
= BAD-ACTOR disvalidates a GOOD-ACTOR, (bad disvalidation)
- BAD-ACTOR disvalidates a BAD-ACTOR, (disvalid in disguise)

And a third category for FLUIDITY, NON-STATIC, NON-ABSOLUTE IDENTITY over time.

### aNONaVALIDATION-MATRIX:
- ACTOR has YET2BEVALUATED
- ACTOR was VALIDATEDMISTAKENLY
- ACTOR was VALIDATEDWRONGLY
- ACTOR was DISVALIDATEDMISTAKENLY
- ACTOR was DISVALIDATEDWRONGLY
- ACTOR was VALIDATEDBUTACTZINVALID
- ACTOR was DISVALIDATEDBUTACTZVALID
- ACTOR has very CONFUZINGACTZ
- ACTOR did something so bad, was banned for life (ironically reversible)
- ACTOR asks for REVALIDATION because of wrong or invalid validation
- PEER wants to see STATUS of ACTOR.
- STATUS TRANSPARENCY - everyone can view, and change the status of anyone. (like a vote)

> WOWZA! This is a much bigger puzzle than originally thought - I love it!

12) TRUSTLESSNESS. In all human history we based our identity verification systems on TRUST. But this is a fundamentally flawed approach, because it assumes we have a defense for every offensive hack. I assure you this is not possible. Instead, BLOCKCHAIN introduces us to a GENIUS concept of TRUSTLESSNESS. Which appeals our old ways of thinking. That we should create systems that works in DISTINCT specific ways, instead of devoting energy to provide remedy, to all the ways it can fail. This is TRUSTLESSNESS.

> if a system requires TRUST to be secure, it can never be totally secured. However, if a system does not require TRUST at all, but is instead TRUSTLESS. That means everything is fully transparent and can be endlessly reviewed by 3rd parties - in order to arrive at a sensible and fair - concensus. Even in the event of unexpective distructive behavior.

## OBSERVATIONZ

Smart-Contracts are (absolutely) able to solve this problem. But lets take it "one-step-at-a-time" - in MVP and PoC phases. Lets systematically add each branch, with a clever system-design that can SCALE-UP into the IDEAL end-solution. Which means the following. With each iteration, expecting failure, then design for-it, not against-it.

> Not gatekeeping, but let everyone in, then upon bad-actz inform the actor of the (potential-offense) - pointing to the rules - give opportunity for reversal, and account for bad-validators.

> start simple and gradually add each branch of interaction, as needed (not before). So as to gradually account for the vast complexity, and do not pretent to solve a massive complexity - all at once. 

> We wish to divert the raging river, with only fresh water, to the city, not to build a damn impervious to every possible flood, while on constant guard of patching leaks. The posture of the system ... is everything. Simply pipe clean water to a safe place.


## OBJECTIVEZ

DIDz PROPOSAL starts with PIRATE or NINJA game. It is subtle, by design, that the MVP is for Self-Assigned Identity. See? Are you a PIRATE or NINJA? You MINT whatever token you CHOOZE. This has obvious FAIL-POINTS for BAD-ACTORZ. Where anyone can mint BOTH. But LOOK! That ACT... of double- mint is not rejected - reveals the ACTZ of (possible) CONZ. See? As you imagine... it scales out to dramatic complexity from there. But the system, is OBJECTIVE and PRESCRIPTIVE, NON-STATIC, NON-ABSOLUTE - can scale-up to REFLECT the state of actual identity in nature. 

> reflect the complexity, accurately, do not try to fight it. Like a Mountain-Stream, not a Castle-Moat. This is very important difference in IDENTITY_DESIGN.

## REVIEW

1) Pirate or Ninja is a fundamental question of human identity, with a light-hearted sneer, to a deeply complex puzzle - that BLOCKCHAIN is capable of resolving fairly. But we have to get it right, and with iteration - eventually we will.

2) The beauty of Pirate or Ninja is that it is a) self-assigned. While it includes the b) observations of ACTZ and c) validation of PEERZ. d) while being aware that BOTH are frequently informed or uninformed. No state is permanent, all acts are reversible with time.

3) Can we SWITCH SIDES? Can we be BOTH? Can we be NEITHER? Wizard or Jester? That's the idea! Reflect reality, don't fight it.

4) The MVP, includes the complex VALIDATION SYSTEM in parallel with the self-assigned Identity SYSTEM. Where BOTH scale-up in COMPLEXITY over time. Here is how:

> The DIDz VALIDATOR DAPP, receives a SINGLE WALLET ADDRESS. It looks up any DIDZ associated with that wallet (SAIDZ). The DIDZ can be self-assigned or anonymously peer-assigned. BOTH rightfully or wrongfully. And with NON-STATIC fluidity - allowing - HUMANZ can change their behavior over time (contrary to popular belief).

> Also, the DIDz VALIDATOR DAPP, takes into account DISVALIDATIONZ. Providing multiple (complex) mechanisms for REVALIDATION, DISVALIDATION and ENVALIDATION schemes.

5) GROUPZ and TRIBEZ. Amazingly, Pirate or Ninja may provide unexpected UTILTY for humanz to group-up more effectively than currently possible. For example, I (might) strongly identify with HERMITZ. But there are also BOTZ, DRAGONZ, WOLVEZ, CATZ, WIZARDZ, JESTERZ, CLOWNZ, FALCONZ... COUGARZ, and SHARKZ, etc. 

> How nice would it feel to look up all the other people who have self-identified the same as you?

6) Anonymity is not possible on BLOCKCHAIN PUBLIC-LEDGER. But it is on NodeJS. That is why this project seems to call out for a HYBRID APPROACH. Not as a false-choice of central or decentral, but of BOTH CENTRALIZED and DECENTRALIZED systems conducted, like a symphony of sycopation, in harmony together. Not one or the other but in clever curation of BOTH.

7) Z-Factor. Why all the 'z's? Because it makes it 'remarkable' and 'unique' The (purposeful) z-misspelling is like "BUIDL". 'Z-factor' conveys the concept, but in a self-identifying distinct way. After people get the idea, confuzion is reduced, by enhancement of words. Opposite of concepts restricted by the ambiquity and cacophony - of too many words used forced into too many disparate purposes! Humanz get that we need more tools of intelligence, and clarity, not less! Z-factor is just one of such powerful tools.

# DESIGN PRINCIPLEZ (codified) //work in progress

1) "Hero to Zero, and Zero to Hero"

> at any moment a hero can act a villian, as at any momant, a villian can act a hero.

2) "Identity is a WISH"

> I am who I say I am, and never totally, what any other SOUL sees me to be.

3) "Self-Assigned-Identity over Social-Assigned-Identity"

> No society, can tell a SOUL who they are, only a SOUL can WISH for itself.

4) "Peer Identity is Flawed"

> Peer identity is a projected-identity, and this is why it is always partially flawed.

5) "Identity is chozen not given"

> All souls, chooze IDENTITY, based on ACTZ.

SMART-CONTRACT mechanism needs to be constantly fluid - or else become eventually flawed and obsolete.

the entire IDENTITY-MECHANISM must be OBJECTIVE and ANONYMOUS. NON-STATIC and NON-ABSOLUTE

FLUIDITY - all people change, so the system of identity must be able to change with the people.

> You never know exactly, who your true friendz are, until you need them the most, and they chooze to ACT or not ACT on your behalf.

> Any HERO can act a ZERO, and any ZERO can rise to HERO, at any time.

7) ACTZ are the behaviors of a person, driven by CHOICEZ.

> No one can deny, what any other SOUL... wishes to be. 

> Filter out BAD-ACTORZ like Mountain-Water.
design IDENTITY SYSTEMS to filter out pollution like mountain-water


> One ACT is forgivable-inno-sense, while the other is distructive-intent. See?


9) Identity is NON-ABSOLUTE. We are always on a SPECTRUM of character.

> Our IDENTITY changes, depending on who validates us.

> So BAD-ACTORZ and BAD-VALIDATORZ need to be seen and not heard. While GOOD-ACTORZ and GOOD-VALIDATORS need to be AMPLIFIED. That is how.

USE DIDz (DIGITAL-IDENTITY-MATRIX) to specify exact behaviors to objectively assign (suspected) ACTZ.

Pay careful attention to "inverzionz" (INVERTZ) because they are very confusing.

FLUID SYSTEM - requires NON-IDENTITY CONCEPTZ.

- STATUS TRANSPARENCY - everyone can view, and change the status of anyone. (like a vote)

> if a system requires TRUST to be secure, it can never be totally secured. However, if a system does not require TRUST at all, but is instead TRUSTLESS. That means everything is fully transparent and can be endlessly reviewed by 3rd parties - in order to arrive at a sensible and fair - concensus. Even in the event of unexpective distructive behavior.


> start simple and gradually add each branch of interaction, as needed (not before). So as to gradually account for the vast complexity, and do not pretent to solve a massive complexity - all at once. 

Reflect reality, don't fight it.

ACCOUNT for humanz who change over time
Account for disvalidationz.
Account for innosense
Account for redemption
Account for groups and tribes
Account for anonymity

After people get the idea, confuzion is reduced, by enhancement of words. Opposite of concepts restricted by the ambiquity and cacophony - of too many words used forced into too many disparate purposes! Humanz get that we need more tools of intelligence, and clarity, not less!
